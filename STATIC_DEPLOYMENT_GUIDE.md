# Varenizer Static Web Application - Deployment Guide

## Understanding the Difference

Your Varenizer application is **100% client-side** (no backend server needed), but browsers have security restrictions that prevent running modern web applications directly from the file system (file:// protocol). You need to serve the files over HTTP.

## üöÄ Quick Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Development Server (Recommended for Development)
```bash
# Install dependencies (one time only)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
Then open: http://localhost:3000

### Option 2: Build + Simple HTTP Server (Production-like)
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Serve the built files (choose one method):

# Method A: Using Python (if you have Python installed)
cd dist
python -m http.server 8000
# Open: http://localhost:8000

# Method B: Using Node.js serve package
npx serve dist
# Open: http://localhost:3000

# Method C: Using PHP (if you have PHP installed)
cd dist
php -S localhost:8000
# Open: http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Portable Standalone Application
Use the `standalone.html` file which works directly in any browser:
```bash
# Simply open standalone.html in any modern browser
# This version works without any build step or server
```

## üåê Deployment Options

### For Personal Use (Local Development)
- **Option 1**: Use `npm run dev` (best for development)
- **Option 3**: Use `standalone.html` (works everywhere)

### For Sharing/Distribution
```bash
# Build the production version
npm run build

# The 'dist' folder contains all files needed
# Upload this folder to any static hosting service:
```

**Static Hosting Services (Free Options):**
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop the `dist` folder
- **Vercel**: Import from GitHub or drag & drop
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to GitHub and enable Pages
- **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase deploy`
- **Surge.sh**: `surge dist/`

### For Offline/Portable Use
```bash
# After building
npm run build

# Copy the entire 'dist' folder to any computer
# Run a simple HTTP server in that folder
cd dist
python -m http.server 8000
```

## üì± PWA (Progressive Web App) Features

Your app includes PWA features for a native-like experience:
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet
- **Installable**: Can be installed like a desktop app
- **Fast loading**: Optimized for performance

To install as an app:
1. Open in Chrome/Edge
2. Look for "Install" button in address bar
3. Click to install as desktop app

## üîß Advanced Options

### Custom Domain
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Upload `dist` folder to your web hosting
3. Point your domain to the hosting service

### Local Network Sharing
```bash
# Share with other devices on your network
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0

# Then access from other devices using your IP:
# http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000
```

### Docker Deployment (Optional)
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

## ‚ö° Key Points

1. **No Backend Server**: Your app is 100% client-side
2. **HTTP Required**: Browsers block file:// for security
3. **Multiple Options**: Choose what works best for you
4. **Production Ready**: Built for real-world deployment
5. **Portable**: Works on any device with a modern browser

## üö® Common Issues

**"CORS Error"**: You opened `index.html` directly
- **Solution**: Use any HTTP server method above

**"Module not found"**: Missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` first

**"Port in use"**: Another app is using the port
- **Solution**: Vite will automatically find another port

**Files not loading**: Build issues
- **Solution**: Delete `node_modules` and `dist`, then `npm install` and `npm run build`
