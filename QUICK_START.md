## What You Need to Know

**Varenizer is a 100% client-side application** - it runs entirely in your browser with no backend server. However, due to browser security restrictions, you cannot simply open the HTML file directly. You need to serve it over HTTP.

## ⚡ Fastest Ways to Run Varenizer

### Option 1: Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
npm install    # First time only
npm run dev    # Every time you want to run it
```

### Option 2: One-Click Scripts
**Windows:**
- Double-click `run-varenizer.bat` or `run-varenizer.ps1`

**Mac/Linux:**
- Double-click `run-varenizer.sh` (or run `./run-varenizer.sh` in terminal)

### Option 3: Standalone Version (No Setup)
- Open `standalone.html` in any modern browser
- Works immediately, no installation required
- Simplified version with core scanning features

### Option 4: Verify Your Setup
```bash
npm run verify    # Check if everything is configured correctly
```

## 🌐 Browser Opens Automatically

When you run Varenizer, it will automatically open in your default browser at:
**http://localhost:3000**

## 🛠️ No Installation Required

Varenizer is a web application that:
- ✅ Runs entirely in your browser
- ✅ Stores data locally on your computer
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ No data sent to external servers
- ✅ Can be installed as a desktop app (PWA)

## 📱 Install as Desktop App

1. Open Varenizer in Chrome or Edge
2. Look for an "Install" button in the address bar
3. Click it to install as a desktop application
4. Access from your desktop/start menu like any other app

## 🔧 If You Have Issues

**"CORS Error" or "Cross-origin" error:**
- You tried to open the HTML file directly
- Use one of the methods above instead

**"Command not found" or "npm not recognized":**
- You need to install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org/
- Then use the one-click scripts above

**Port already in use:**
- Varenizer will automatically find another port (3001, 3002, etc.)
